**CoinWatch** is an Android cryptocurrency app providing real-time coin prices, price histories, and market data.

The app is built using the latest [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/recommendations) - resulting in a scalable, modularised and testable app.

# üß± Architecture 
The design of CoinWatch follows a few key principles:
1. Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF) - State flows in one direction, and events that modify the data flow in the opposite direction.
2. Single Source of Truth (SSOT) - The SSOT is the owner of data, and only the SSOT can modify or mutate it.
3. Drive UI from immutable data models - App data is contained within persistent data models and drives UI components.

A high-level overview of the app's architecture is displayed below. The architecture follows [Google's official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).
